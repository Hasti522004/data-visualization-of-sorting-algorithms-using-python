## Features
- Visualization of sorting algorithms using animations.
- Highlighting of array accesses and modifications.
- Support for multiple sorting algorithms.
- Configurable parameters like array size and animation speed.

## Technology Stack
- **Python:** Programming language used for implementing the sorting algorithms and visualization.
- **NumPy:** Library used for numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib:** Library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **NumPy:** Install NumPy using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage Instructions

To use the sorting algorithm visualization, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hasti522004/data-visualization-of-sorting-algorithms-using-python.git
 ```
2. Install Libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
3. Run the Python script:
```sh
python visualize_sorting.py
```
4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to visualize sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

1. **Insertion Sort**
   - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.

2. **Quick Sort**
   - QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.

3. **Merge Sort**
   - Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm that divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.

4. **Heap Sort**
   - Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.

5. **Bubble Sort**
   - Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

6. **Tim Sort**
   - Tim Sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.
